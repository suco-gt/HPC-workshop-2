# Workshop Part II 
In this section, you'll be working on a number of GPU computing problems with the use of CUDA (well, Numba). Each of the problems, along with relevant libraries, are within this folder. You can access both the problem document, ``problem.md``, as well a setup guide, ``setup.md``.

## Problems
You can access the ``problems.md`` file to check out today's problems. They will also be included on the slides. 
## Setup
You can navigate to the ``setup.md`` file to install dependencies and load relevant modules.
