# Workshop Part II 
In this section, you'll be working on a number of GPU computing problems with the use of CUDA (well, Numba). Each of the problems, along with relevant libraries, are within this folder. You can access both the problem document, ``problem.md``, as well a setup guide, ``setup.md``. If you're unable to access a GPU through the cluster, you may also run your exercises via a [Google Colaboratory File](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1drkxhpHHlo64-A72GklSiic5vv7op9k_/view?usp=sharing) after setting your hardware accelerator to a GPU.

Credits to [Sasha Rush](https://github.com/srush/GPU-Puzzles/tree/main) for today's problems. More are available at the linked repository. 

## Problems
You can access the ``problems.md`` file to check out today's problems. They will also be included on the slides. 
## Setup
You can navigate to the ``setup.md`` file to install dependencies and load relevant modules.
