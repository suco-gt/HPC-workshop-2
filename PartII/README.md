# Workshop Part II 
In this section, you'll be working on a number of GPU computing problems with the use of CUDA (well, Numba). Each of the problems, along with relevant libraries, are within this folder. You can access both the problem document, ``problem.md``, as well a setup guide, ``setup.md``. If you're unable to access a GPU through the cluster, or you'd like to access visualizations of the CUDA code, you may also run your exercises via a [Google Colaboratory File](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1drkxhpHHlo64-A72GklSiic5vv7op9k_/view?usp=sharing) after setting your hardware accelerator to a GPU. Make a copy of this file and run it on your own device. You can also run both, if you'd like to access visualizations and run your code on the cluster itself.

Credits to [Sasha Rush](https://github.com/srush/GPU-Puzzles/tree/main) for today's problems. More are available at the linked repository. 

## Problems
You can access the ``problems.md`` file to check out today's problems. They will also be included on the slides. 
## Setup
You can navigate to the ``setup.md`` file to install dependencies and load relevant modules.
